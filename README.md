Data Leakage Detection using Cloud Computing
DEMO SNAPS

Implementation and Explanation

Agent gets Registered himself/herself in cloud
 
Agent gets himself registered in the system after entering the field details. If he already has a account, he can go to already have an account button.  

 
After successful registration process. 








Login Form
 


Distributor enters the Agent ID to check status of respective agent
 


The query keyword present in data which is to be searched
 

We enter the Agent Key which is provided by the system as a secret key for agent

So here, what we observe is, the distributor first distributes the data to agents, and if agents leaks the data to any third parties, he would be using the ICMP protocols for transferring data, as the data is present in encrypted form and the decrypted form of it can only be sent through ICMP protocol which uses elliptical Curve cryptography, Advance encryption standard in order to decrypt the data. We then search the data which had the transmission protocol ICMP used, we then get the retrieved result which contains the leaked data.
